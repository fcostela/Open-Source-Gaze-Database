Open-source Gaze database

I provide a database of eye movements collected, using an infra-red, video-camera, EyeLink 1000 system, from 95 participants as they viewed ‘Hollywood’ video clips from an array of 206 clips that were 30-second duration or eleven clips of 30-minutes for a total viewing time of about 60 hours. The database also provides the 30-second video clip files, preview of the 30-minute clips, and subjective ratings of the content of the videos for each in categories: (1) genre; (2) importance of human faces; (3) importance of human figures; (4) importance of man-made objects; (5) importance of nature; (6) auditory information; (7) lighting; and (8) environment type. Precise timing of the scene cuts within the clips and the democratic gaze scanpath position (center of interest) per frame are provided. This eye-movement dataset has the widest age range (22 to 85 years) and is the third largest (in recorded video viewing time) of those that have been made available to the research community to date.

The dataset can be used without restriction for educational and research purposes, providing that this paper is cited in any published work. Even though these data have been de-identified, since it is human-subjects data, most institutional review boards (IRB), ethics boards and similar will want to review your use of the data, before you use it, to ensure that it was collected under an approved human-subjects-research (e.g. IRB) protocol, that informed consent was obtained from the participants in the study, and that we will never provide you with the subjects’ personal information (e.g. names). In the USA, use of such data would be considered “exempt” or “not human subjects research”. But, it is usually not up to you to make that decision. Instead, the decision must be made by the IRB (or similar) that approves your research. Obtaining that designation, and hence approval to handle the data is your responsibility.


If you do use this dataset I ask you kindly cite this publication:
